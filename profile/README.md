[Neuromatch](https://neuromatch.io/) is a 501c3 not-for-profit organization in the United States. We are an online community of
computational neuroscientists whose mission is to foster inclusive global interactions for learning, mentorship, networking,
and professional development.

We run 2 organizations within Neuromatch: Neuromatch Academy ([academy.neuromatch.io](https://academy.neuromatch.io/))
and Neuromatch Conference ([conference.neuromatch.io](http://conference.neuromatch.io/))

## History

- Our first success was NMC1 held online on March 30-31st, 2020 which brought together nearly 3,000 attendees from around the world
as part of 120 talks given by both senior and junior scientists. Reflecting our core philosophy of building connections and community
we matched over 500 participants to 6 other partners each, based on interests gleaned from natural language processing of submitted abstracts.
A follow up conference, NMC2 was held May 25â€“27 2020 which attracted nearly 4,000 participants and offered new forms of interaction between attendees.
- In July 2020 we organized a three-week-long online summer school for July 13-31, 2020 in response to the current Covid-19 crisis which
has shut down nearly every summer program in the world at which students, postdocs and faculty would normally gather to acquire crucial skills
and build networks that are the lifeblood of academic science. This crisis left an enormous hole in the career prospects of our most valuable
and vulnerable scientists.
- In November 2020, we held NMC3, which attracted thousands of attendees across all areas of neuroscience.
- In December 2021, we held
NMC4 which features many innovations added to the conference such as local meetups, preprint linking, and kid sessions.
